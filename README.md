Opens to an image of gallows and asks the user to guess a letter.

If user guesses an incorrect letter, part of the stick figure appears and the letter appears next to the "missed letters" section.

If user guesses a correct letter, it will be added to the appropriate spot.

The game ends when either the user guesses the correct word or when the user has too many incorrect guesses (causing the stick figure to be completed). 
After the game ends, the user is asked if they would like to play again.
